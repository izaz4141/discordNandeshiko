At the end of season one, in episode 12 of the series, she is seen solo camping in the same location that episode 1 takes place (Lake Motosu) where, by coincidence, she runs into Rin after a text exchange between the two in which she receives a picture form Rin of herself taking a photo of Mount Fuji.

Some examples being, sleeping and getting lost in the mountains, crashing against the walls or even falling asleep in the library of the school. All of this is to the annoyance of Rin.
