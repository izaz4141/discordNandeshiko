In the shorts' story, the Seven Gods of Fortune slack in their duties in heaven, and Susanoo-no-Mikoto banishes them to Awaji Island. In order to return to the heavenly realm, they must help bring happiness to humans and rebuild their virtue. The outcast gods reluctantly grant human wishes and accumulate points in their \"god phones\" to be able to return to heaven. They aim to perform good deeds on particularly auspicious days to maximize point accumulation. Despite their best efforts at accumulating virtue, sometimes the Seven Gods of Fortune end up bringing misfortune to humans. When they fail, they lose points, further prolonging their stay on Awaji Island.\r\n\r\n(Source: ANN)",

But now, the number of vampires is increasing and a mysterious, artificial blood source called Ascra has appeared.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese government, in turn, creates \"Code Zero,\" an unit within the army tasked with taking down the vampiric forces. And what better way to track vampires than by using vampires?\r\n\r\nCreated by Lieutenant General Nakajima, this unit has historically been in the business of information war, but has been re-assigned to solve the vampire crisis. \r\n\r\n(Source: Funimation, edited)",

Created by the best of technology, the game claims to take \"reality to its extremes,\" from stunning graphics, NPCs' behavior, to the scent of vegetation, and even the sensation of wind brushing against the skin\u2014everything was the result of an ultimate workmanship.\r\n\r\nExcept, the game is a little too realistic and messy to clear. Kiwame Quest features over ten quadrillion flags and reflects the players' real-life physical abilities in the game. Being hit in the game also hurts in real life and slash wounds take days to heal.\r\n\r\nThe only reward here is the sense of accomplishment. Conquer the most stressful game in history that can't be played casually!\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL News)\r\n\r\nEpisode 1 was streamed in advance on March 31, 2021.

Later, the boy introduces himself as You Asakura, a Shaman-in-training, and demonstrates his powers by teaming up with the ghost of six-hundred-year-old samurai Amidamaru to save Manta from a group of thugs. You befriends Manta due to his ability to see spirits, and with the help of Amidamaru, they set out to accomplish You's goal of becoming the next Shaman King.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The two ride on Lugia's back as it brings them along on a bizarre adventure across the seas. As it lets the two back on the ground, Satoshi and Gou bid their farewells to Lugia and return to Sakuragi Institute.\r\n\r\nImpressed by Gou's findings and Satoshi's insight taken during their encounter, Sakuragi requests for the duo to be his new research partners. And so the duo's journey begins, traveling across multiple regions to meet many new Pok\u00e9mon\u2014including ones that have the ability to Gigantamax!\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, when Shinichi spots two suspicious men and decides to follow them, he inadvertently becomes witness to a disturbing illegal activity. Unfortunately, he is caught in the act, so the men dose him with an experimental drug formulated by their criminal organization, leaving him to his death. However, to his own astonishment, Shinichi lives to see another day, but now in the body of a seven-year-old child.\r\n\r\nPerfectly preserving his original intelligence, he hides his real identity from everyone, including his childhood friend Ran Mouri and her father, private detective Kogorou Mouri. To this end, he takes on the alias of Conan Edogawa, inspired by the mystery writers Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa.\r\n\r\nDetective Conan follows Shinichi who, as Conan, starts secretly solving the senior Mouri's cases from behind the scenes with his still exceptional sleuthing skills, while covertly investigating the organization responsible for his current state, hoping to reverse the drug's effects someday.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After all, Hori has a perfect combination of beauty and brains, while Miyamura appears meek and distant to his fellow classmates. However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both of their hidden selves bare. Even though she is popular at school, Hori has little time to socialize with her friends due to housework. On the other hand, Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his body bearing secret tattoos and piercings that make him look like a gentle delinquent.\r\n\r\nHaving opposite personalities yet sharing odd similarities, the two quickly become friends and often spend time together in Hori's home. As they both emerge from their shells, they share with each other a side of themselves concealed from the outside world.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When night falls, he heads to \"S,\" an illegal underground race inside a mine where skaters compete in highly dangerous situations. After a loss that results in his skateboard being destroyed and his arm being broken, Reki is now incapable of practicing at all.\r\n\r\nWhile working, Reki runs into his new classmate, Langa Hasegawa, a half-Canadian and half-Japanese boy with no skateboarding experience whatsoever. Langa is in desperate need of money. After they both visit \"S\" when tasked by Reki's boss, they get into trouble and are forced into a bet that requires Langa to skate in a race. However, the mysterious transfer student holds a trump card that Reki is unaware of, one which might help him win the race in the most unexpected way.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unbeknownst to humans, this network has become home to life forms known as \"Digimon.\"\r\n\r\nFifth-grader Taichi Yagami is preparing for summer camp when strange occurrences begin in Tokyo; certain electronic systems have started going haywire. When he discovers that his sister and mother are trapped on an unstoppable train, he rushes to the nearby station. Suddenly, Taichi is transported to another world where he meets a strange creature by the name of Agumon, who somehow already knows his name. Taichi also receives a strange device called a \"Digivice,\" which allows him to communicate with the undigitized world.\r\n\r\nTaichi discovers he is in the \"Network,\" and virus-like Digimon are attacking the areas that maintain Tokyo\u2019s electronic systems. It is up to Taichi and his new partner Agumon to stop these cyberattacks before the whole world is threatened by the actions of mischievous Digimon.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Suou's main rival, Midori Soshizaki, invites her to join up on the same team in high school, with a promise that she'll never let Suou \"play alone.\" It's an earnest offer, but the question is whether Suou will take her up on it.

Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults. \r\n\r\n(Source: AniDB)",

Junior high school student Kezuru wakes up after a strange dream featuring himself as a wizard, a creature called \"mazin,\" and a mysterious girl. The next day, his friend Kuracchi proudly shows off the newly launched Mazica Party card game. To Kezuru's shock, all the characters drawn in the game's cards are just like the ones in his dream.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Kezuru receives a notification for an event at the major international company Mazica. Intrigued, Kezuru goes to the Mazica Store as directed, only to meet the Mazica CEO himself, Jeff Johns. Johns says, \"I have great expectations for you,\" and hands Kezuru Mazica Gear.\r\n\r\nOn his way back home, Kezuru is attacked by an airship-like creature. Just when he thinks, \"this is it!\" to himself, his Mazica Gear erupts and a magic book appears. When he scratches a card, he seals a contract with Barunya, a \"mazin\" creature that is an odd remixed fusion between an airship and a cat.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious girl Anya says Kezuru and those of his ilk will be \"the true wizards who save the world.\" Amid all these mysterious revelations, Kezuru enrolls in the Mazica Academy and engages in Mazica Party card battles alongside his partner mazin.\r\n\r\n(Source: ANN)",

Sawa Yukimura, whose family was killed when she was young, continues to search for Janome, the executioner of the Nue.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL News)\r\n\r\nThe series was streamed one week in advance of Japan's broadcast beginning on March 31, 2021 on Hulu.
